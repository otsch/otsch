### Hey there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Christian Olear but everyone calls me otsch. I'm a Web Developer based in Linz (Austria).

I enjoy writing PHP and I have a lot of experience with web crawling and scraping, so I started the open source project [crwlr.software](https://www.crwlr.software) ([crwlrsoft on github](https://github.com/crwlrsoft)) where I publish library packages helping with this kind of tasks.

Besides that I currently also try to build a web crawling and scraping service, using that software, over at [crwl.io](https://www.crwl.io).

If you have any questions you can contact me any time on [twitter](https://twitter.com/chrolear) or via [the contact form at otsch.codes](https://www.otsch.codes/contact). Don't be shy ðŸ™‚
